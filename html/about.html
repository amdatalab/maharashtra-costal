                <h1>MAHARASHTRA COASTLINE</h1>
                <p>Maharashtra is the second most populous and third largest state of India. It spread over
                    307713 Sq. Km and situated over west coast of India. Maharashtra occupies the western and
                    central part of the country and as per statistical data available, Maharashtra has a long
                    coastline stretching 720 kilometers along the Arabian Sea, which is divided, among 6<br>
                    Districts as under: Out of this 720 Kms coastal length 400 Kms length is naturally protected, &
                    About 320 Kms length is vulnerable to erosion. Out of this, protection for 145 Kms has been
                    protected by artificial means such as Construction of Anti Sea Erosion Bund, Sea Wall, and each
                    Nourishment inform of Geotubes etc. The remaining length is yet to be protected.<br>

                        For Development Of setback planning, hazard zoning, erosion – accretion studies, regional
                        sediment budgets, modeling of coastal morph dynamics,
                        survey of coastline with latest technology is required for preparing Coastal Management Plan for
                        erosion control measures to ensure effective protection of shore lines, coastal infrastructure,
                        livelihoods and lives.<br>
                        IN Maharashtra Integrated Coastal Zone Management Is One Of The Tools To Achieve This Goal.
                        Coastal Zones Involve Many Different Elements Of Development And Interaction And These Elements
                        Change Due To Natural Or Human Factors.

                        Temporal Change In Coastal Zones Is Reflected On The Coast Line. Coast Line Advance And Retreat
                        Cause Major Changes On Coastal Zones.
